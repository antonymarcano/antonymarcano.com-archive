				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, I came across <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2011/03/when-to-cuke">this post by Ryan Bigg</a> where he talks of the pains he&#8217;s experienced with Cucumber.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Ryan, the outcome was a positive one, he ended up finding what appears to be a nice looking API for automating test-execution.</p>
<p>The experience he had with Cucumber, however, is a common one. Often teams start using Cucumber in an effort to reduce the need for programming skills when writing automated tests.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the problem that Cucumber and other BDD tools are trying to solve and this is why so many teams who misuse it in this way experience difficulty and frustration.</p>
<p>BDD tools like Cucumber are designed to help teams and their customers arrive at a shared understanding of the problem they wish to solve (in terms of the user&#8217;s goals and tasks). It&#8217;s not really intended to describe the solution (i.e. step-by-step interactions with the GUI).</p>
<p>If your Cucumber scenarios have words such as &#8220;click&#8221; or &#8220;type&#8221; or mention field names and the like, it&#8217;s probable that you&#8217;re either:<br />
a) Using Cucumber to automate test-execution (not what it was intended for) or<br />
b) Trying to do BDD but writing the scenarios at too low a level of detail.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re doing the latter (b)&#8230; then you may find <a href="/blog/2011/03/goals-tasks-action/">the post I wrote over the weekend useful</a>.</p>
<p>If what you&#8217;re doing is (a) then <a href="/blog/2011/03/goals-tasks-action/">the post I wrote over the weekend</a> might help you go down a path where automating your tests will make the transition to BDD that much easier.</p>
<p>If you really, really only want to automate test-execution then you might find that you&#8217;re putting Cucumber where it&#8217;s not supposed to go&#8230; and just so you know &#8211; that&#8217;s probably going to hurt <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This first appeared <a href="http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/2255">on my old blog in June 2005</a>.</em></p>
<p>Somebody I know who was doing some (unscripted) testing spoke of being bored the other day&#8230; I have always found boredom to be a sign that something is wrong.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2636/3749350596_2365bbe912_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" /></p>
<p>I believe, as has been said by Kaner et al, that testing is a brain-engaged activity. If that is the case, why would I ever be bored?</p>
<p>Borrowing the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CodeSmell ">Smell</a> metaphor&#8230;<!--break--> I would say that boredom is a Bad Testing Smell. If it isn&#8217;t a bad smell, it is a whiff of an underlying bad-smell for sure.</p>
<p>If on the rare occasion I find that I am bored, I&#8217;d ask myself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Am I testing this area more than I need to? (if so, why?)</li>
<li>Am I losing concentration because my brain is tired? Do I need a break?</li>
<li>Is what I am doing so repetitive that perhaps it should be automated?</li>
<li>Is there a better way of testing this feature?</li>
</ol>
<p>If I answer &#8220;yes&#8221; to any of these, I know that perhaps I need to do something differently. Whether that is feasible in a given context, might be a different story.</p>
<p><strong>Update 9th July 2010:</strong> This applies to scripted testing as much as it does to exploratory testing. Generally, I&#8217;ve found that boredom during scripted testing is because we&#8217;re asking a human to do something we should be asking a computer to do&#8230; The main barrier to this, in my experience, is that it is harder to write the automated tests than to write manual scripted tests&#8230; so, I look for ways to make automated tests as easy to write as manual scripted ones. Usually, I can achieve this with a little effort and have found it makes a huge difference.</p>
