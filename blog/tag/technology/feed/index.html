				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/02/the-oh-sh_t-moment-that-nokia-decided-to-abandon-meego/">Engadget reported that Nokia had decided to abandon MeeGo in favour of Windows Mobile</a>. What was interesting is the reported process used to make this decision:</p>
<blockquote><p>Elop drew out what he knew about the plans for MeeGo on a whiteboard, with a different color marker for the products being developed, their target date for introduction, and the current levels of bugs in each product. Soon the whiteboard was filled with color, and the news was not good: At its current pace, Nokia was on track to introduce only three MeeGo-driven models before 2014-far too slow to keep the company in the game.</p></blockquote>
<p>This brought to mind some blog posts I wrote in early 2010 (now copied to this blog &#8211; see previous two entries). I talked about &#8216;critical mass&#8217;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Critical Mass of Software: the state of a software system when the cost of changing it (enhancement or correcting defects) is less economical than re-writing it.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In the case of Nokia and MeeGo, there isn&#8217;t enough information to know if that&#8217;s what had happened but it does suggest, at least, that it was more economical to choose an alternative third-party OS than to continue with MeeGo. Integrating Windows Mobile is going to come at some cost, of course, but clearly they decided it was less than sticking with their current strategy.</p>
<p>This is an example of modern markets demanding more sustainable, adaptive and agile product development cycles, and a company recognising this and acting on it.</p>
<p>It is also a demonstration of how an ever-growing cost of change (e.g. through the number of bugs consuming resources that would otherwise be adding new value) is really deferring of cost &#8211; i.e. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqeJFYwnkjE">technical debt</a>.</p>
<p>There are many arguments for &#8216;prudent&#8217; acceptance of technical debt&#8230; This story, I think, is an example of where it wasn&#8217;t obvious when that debt was no longer prudent until it was too late for MeeGo as a product.</p>
<p>And this is one of the problems with some lean concepts applied to new products and start-ups. The advice is often to get feedback from the market quickly by hacking the product together and release as quickly as possible. The trouble is, at what point do we take a step back and change to more sustainable practices? Probably around the time the product is selling&#8230; but then we&#8217;re under pressure from competitors who have seen our innovations and want to copy them&#8230; so we&#8217;re tempted to keep hacking out more features only to find that the faster we hack the slower we go.</p>
<p>There is no magic answer, to the question &#8220;when do we stop hacking and start sustainably building?&#8221; We might wait until we&#8217;re making enough money to hire more people to do remedial work.</p>
<p>As soon as we find we&#8217;re enhancing a feature, it might mean that it&#8217;s a key part of our product &#8211; one we&#8217;re going to keep. We might then treat any code we touch during that enhancement as <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0131177052">legacy code</a>, building in the cost of remedial work into the enhancement.</p>
<p>Some would argue that it&#8217;s faster overall to never hack things in and to commit to  sustainable product development practices from the get-go. This probably applies in many cases but especially to large complex products like operating systems.</p>
<p>Whatever the strategy used, there will come a point where you can&#8217;t hack in any more features. The question is, will you decide when that happens or will the cost of change decide for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s something wrong with many behaviour specs (or acceptance tests). It&#8217;s been this way for some time. I&#8217;ve written about this <a href="http://antonymarcano.com/blog/2010/08/youre-almost-cuking-it/">once</a> or <a href="http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/6704">twice</a> before, referencing this <a href="http://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200710/20071013-In%20Praise%20of%20Abstraction.html">post by Kevin Lawrence from 2007</a>.</p>
<p>So, first things first, I want to take this opportunity to update the terminology I use&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Goals -&gt; Tasks -&gt; Actions</strong><br />
A useful technique used in User-Centred Design (UCD) and Human Computer Interface (HCI) design is Task Analysis. There are three layers of detail often talked about in Task Analysis:</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> What we&#8217;re trying to achieve which has one or more&#8230;<br />
<strong>Tasks:</strong> The high-level work-item that we complete to fulfil the goal, each having one or more&#8230;<br />
<strong>Actions:</strong> The specific steps or interactions we execute to complete the task.</p>
<p>Previously, the terms used by Kevin, myself (and several others) were Goal-&gt;Activities-&gt;Tasks. From now on, I&#8217;m going to use the UCD/HCI/Task Analysis terms Goal-&gt;Task-&gt;Action. It&#8217;s exactly the same model &#8211; just with different labels at the three layers of detail.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s wrong with your average behaviour spec?</strong><br />
Let&#8217;s look at a common example&#8230; The calculator. For convenience, I&#8217;m going to borrow this one from <a href="http://cukes.info">the cucumber website[1]</a>.</p>
<p><code>Scenario: Add two numbers<br />
Given I have entered 10 into the calculator<br />
And I have entered 5 into the calculator<br />
When I press add<br />
Then the result should be 15 on the screen<br />
</code><br />
[1]<em>note: I&#8217;m using this example for convenience and simplicity. The value of the example on the cucumber website is to demonstrate how easy cucumber is to use and not necessarily as an exemplar feature spec</em></p>
<p>What would you say the scenario&#8217;s name and steps are representing? Goals and Tasks or Tasks and Actions?</p>
<p>I’d argue that adding two numbers is a task and the steps shown above are actions.</p>
<p>Instead, I try to write the spec (or test) with a scenario-specific goal and the steps as tasks.</p>
<p><code>Scenario: sum of two numbers<br />
When I add 10 and 5<br />
Then I should see the answer 15<br />
</code></p>
<p>I.e.:<br />
<code>Scenario: &lt;A scenario specific goal&gt;<br />
Given &lt;Something that needs to have happened or be true&gt;<br />
When &lt;Some task I must do&gt;<br />
Then &lt;Some way I know I've achieved my goal&gt;<br />
</code></p>
<p><strong>Another Typical Example</strong><br />
Let&#8217;s apply this to another typical example that might be closer to what some people are used to seeing:</p>
<p><code>Scenario: Search for the cucumber homepage<br />
Given I am at http://google.com<br />
When I enter "cucumber" into the search field<br />
and click "Search"<br />
Then the top result should say "Cucumber - Making BDD fun"<br />
</code></p>
<p>Again this is talking in terms of <strong>actions</strong>. As soon as I&#8217;m talking in terms of click, enter, type or other user-action, I know I&#8217;m going into too much detail. Instead, I write this:</p>
<p><code>Scenario: Find the Cucumber home page<br />
When I search for "Cucumber"<br />
Then the top result should say "Cucumber - Making BDD fun"<br />
</code></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><br />
In the calculator example, the outcome the business is interested in for the first scenario is that we get the correct sum of two numbers. The steps in the scenario should help us arrive at a shared understanding of what &#8216;correct&#8217; means. How we solve the problem of getting the numbers into the calculator and choosing the operator is a separate issue. That&#8217;s detail we can defer. It may be better to explore the specifics of the workflow using, sketches, conversation, wire-frames or by seeing and using our new calculator.</p>
<p>So, expressing our scenarios in terms of goals and tasks helps the delivery team and the business arrive at a shared understanding of the problem we&#8217;re trying to solve in that scenario.</p>
<p>Expressing the scenario in terms of the clicks, presses and even fields we&#8217;re typing into is focusing on a solution, not the problem we&#8217;re trying to solve.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another benefit to doing it this way&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>A Practical Concern &#8211; Maintainability</strong><br />
The first calculator example follows reverse-polish notation for the sequence of <strong>actions</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>enter the first number</li>
<li>enter the second number</li>
<li>press add</li>
</ol>
<p>If we put that detail in the scenarios, that workflow will be repeated everywhere &#8211; for addition, subtraction, division, multiplication&#8230; and anywhere any calculation is described.</p>
<p>What happens if the workflow for this calculator (such as the UI or API) changes from a reverse-polish notation to a more conventional workflow for a calculator? Like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>enter the first number</li>
<li>press add</li>
<li>enter the second number</li>
<li>press equals</li>
</ol>
<p>The correct answer hasn&#8217;t changed &#8211; i.e. the &#8216;business rule&#8217; is the same &#8211; it&#8217;s just the sequence of actions has changed.</p>
<p>Now we have to go through all the feature files and update all the scenarios. In the case of our calculator that may only be a few files covering add, subtract, divide, multiply. For something larger and more complex this could be a lot of work.</p>
<p>Instead, putting this in the code of the step-definition means that this:<br />
<code><br />
When ^I (add|subtract|divide|multiply) (.*) (?:and|from|by)? (.*) do |operator, first_number, second_number|<br />
@calc = @calc ||= Calculator.new<br />
@calc.enter first_number<br />
@calc.enter second_number<br />
@calc.send operator.to_sym<br />
end<br />
</code></p>
<p>Would have to change to this:<br />
<code><br />
When ^I (add|subtract|divide|multiply) (.*) (?:and|from|by)? (.*) do |operator, first_number, second_number|<br />
@calc = @calc ||= Calculator.new<br />
@calc.enter first_number<br />
@calc.send operator.to_sym #moved up from the bottom<br />
@calc.enter second_number<br />
@calc.calculate                     #new action for the conventional calculator workflow<br />
end<br />
</code></p>
<p>Nothing else would need to change &#8211; other than the product of course. By writing the steps as tasks, all of our feature files would still accurately illustrate the business rule even though the workflow of the interface (gui or api) has changed.</p>
<p><strong>Taking your scenario-steps to task</strong><br />
So, taking this approach helps us to reduce our maintenance overheads. Putting the Actions inside the step definition makes our tests less brittle. When the workflow changes we only need to update our specs in one place &#8211; the step-definitions.</p>
<p>Of, perhaps, greater importance &#8211; by capturing the user&#8217;s scenario-specific goal as the scenario name and the tasks as the steps, the team are working towards a shared understanding of the part of the problem we&#8217;re trying to solve not a solution we might be prematurely settling upon. When rolled up with the broader context (expressed in the user-story and its other scenarios) it gives us a focus on solving the wider problem rather than biasing the solution.</p>
<p>Sometimes, at first, it&#8217;s hard to see how to express the scenario and is easier when people start by talking of clicks, presses and what they&#8217;re entering. And that&#8217;s ok. Maybe that&#8217;s where the team needs to start the conversation. Just because that&#8217;s where you start, ask &#8220;why are we doing those actions&#8221; a few times, and it doesn&#8217;t have to be where you end up.</p>
