				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This first appeared <a href="http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/2255">on my old blog in June 2005</a>.</em></p>
<p>Somebody I know who was doing some (unscripted) testing spoke of being bored the other day&#8230; I have always found boredom to be a sign that something is wrong.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2636/3749350596_2365bbe912_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" /></p>
<p>I believe, as has been said by Kaner et al, that testing is a brain-engaged activity. If that is the case, why would I ever be bored?</p>
<p>Borrowing the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CodeSmell ">Smell</a> metaphor&#8230;<!--break--> I would say that boredom is a Bad Testing Smell. If it isn&#8217;t a bad smell, it is a whiff of an underlying bad-smell for sure.</p>
<p>If on the rare occasion I find that I am bored, I&#8217;d ask myself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Am I testing this area more than I need to? (if so, why?)</li>
<li>Am I losing concentration because my brain is tired? Do I need a break?</li>
<li>Is what I am doing so repetitive that perhaps it should be automated?</li>
<li>Is there a better way of testing this feature?</li>
</ol>
<p>If I answer &#8220;yes&#8221; to any of these, I know that perhaps I need to do something differently. Whether that is feasible in a given context, might be a different story.</p>
<p><strong>Update 9th July 2010:</strong> This applies to scripted testing as much as it does to exploratory testing. Generally, I&#8217;ve found that boredom during scripted testing is because we&#8217;re asking a human to do something we should be asking a computer to do&#8230; The main barrier to this, in my experience, is that it is harder to write the automated tests than to write manual scripted tests&#8230; so, I look for ways to make automated tests as easy to write as manual scripted ones. Usually, I can achieve this with a little effort and have found it makes a huge difference.</p>
