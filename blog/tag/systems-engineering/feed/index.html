				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>&#8220;Building software&#8221;</strong></em> is a phrase I hear used time and again. Indeed, many do still think of software development as akin to construction.  Modern (agile) software development doesn&#8217;t feel like that to me. There was a time, like the construction architect, when we had to increment and iterate on paper and in models. The cost of computing was too high to do such iteration inside the machine. The cost difference between making a small change in our understanding and reflecting that in the actual product was too great. The cost of change meant that we had to treat the creation of software like constructing buildings or bridges. But those times are, or should be, in the past.</p>
<p>To me, modern (agile)<em><strong> software development</strong> <strong>feels more like pottery</strong></em>. But, instead of &#8216;throwing clay&#8217; we throw our consciousness, in the form of electrons flowing over silicon, onto a spinning wheel of user-story implementation cycles.</p>

<p>We evolve our understanding of what our customer wants with each conversation. We reflect that understanding by evolving the product&#8217;s shape as we touch the outer surface with each new automated acceptance test (or example scenario). We evolve its structure as we touch the inner surface with each new unit test (or unit specification). We keep it supple as we moisten it with each refactoring. Our customer looks on, gives us feedback and we start the next revolution of the <em>software development wheel</em>. Never letting the product dry and harden; keeping it flexible, malleable, soft(ware).</p>
<p>There is nothing that feels like construction here. I never feel like I&#8217;m &#8220;building&#8221; something. Much more like I&#8217;m evolving my understanding, evolving the product, evolving my understanding again and so on.</p>
<p>For these reasons l am not comfortable with referring to this process as &#8220;building&#8221;. I&#8217;m also not comfortable calling it &#8220;throwing&#8221; (as in pottery).</p>
<p>I am very comfortable calling it &#8220;development&#8221;. I use the word &#8220;develop&#8221; in terms of its literal meaning:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>to bring into being or activity; generate; evolve.</em>&#8221;<br />
-<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/develop">dictionary.com</a></p></blockquote>
<p>From the first thought of a new idea, through each conversation along the way, to each revolution of the software development wheel, I develop products.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t &#8220;build&#8221;.</p>
<p>I create. I make. I shape. I evolve.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
Footnote: I&#8217;m not aware of anyone drawing this analogy before. If you have heard or read someone explain it in this way before now, please let me know.</p>
