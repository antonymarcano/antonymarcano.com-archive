				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This originally appeared on my old blog on 16th March 2010&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Others have talked about the virtues of <a href="http://blog.energizedwork.com/2005/05/slicing-cake.html">stories as vertical slices of a problem</a> (end-to-end capabilities) rather than horizontal slices (system layers or components). So, if we slice the problem <em>with</em> user stories, how do we slice the user-stories themselves?</p>
<p>If, as I sometimes say, acceptance tests (a.k.a. examples/scenarios/acceptance-criteria) are the knife with which we slice a story into even thinner vertical slices, then I would say my observation of &#8216;tasks&#8217; is that they are used as the knife used to cut a story into horizontal slices. This feels wrong&#8230;</p>
<p>Sometimes I also wonder, hasn&#8217;t anyone else noticed that the idea of counting the effort of completed tasks on burn-down/up charts is counter to the value that we measure progress only with working software? Surely it makes more sense to measure progress with passing tests (<a href="http://www.developsense.com/blog/2009/09/tests-vs-checks-should-we-call-test/">or &#8220;checks&#8221;</a> &#8211; whichever you prefer).</p>
<p>These are two of the reasons I&#8217;ve never felt very comfortable with tasks, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>they&#8217;re often applied in such a way that the story is sliced horizontally</li>
<li>they encourage measuring progress in a less meaningful way than working software</li>
</ul>
<p>Tasks are, however, very useful for teams at first. Just like anything else we learn how to do, learning how to do it on paper can often help us then discard the paper and do the workings in our heads. However, what I&#8217;ve noticed is that most teams I&#8217;ve worked with continue to write and estimate tasks long after the practice is useful or relevant to them.</p>
<p>For example, there comes a time for many teams where tasks become repetitive. &#8220;Add x to the Model&#8221;, &#8220;Change View&#8221;&#8230; and so on. Is this adding value to the process or are you just doing it because the process says you should do it?</p>
<p>Simply finding that your tasks are repetitive doesn&#8217;t mean the team is ready to stop using them. There is another important ingredient, meaningful acceptance criteria (scenarios / acceptance-tests / examples).</p>
<p>I often see stories with acceptance criteria such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must have a link to save the profile</li>
<li>Must have a drop down to select business sector</li>
<li>Business sector must be mandatory</li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these are &#8220;acceptance criteria&#8221; they aren&#8217;t what we mean by acceptance criteria in the context of user stories. Firstly, they are talking about how the user interacts rather than what they need to achieve (I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/6704">talked about this before</a>). Secondly, they aren&#8217;t examples. What we want are the variations that alter the behaviour or response of the product:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should create a new profile</li>
<li>Profile cannot be saved with blank &#8220;business sector&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>As our product fulfils each of these criteria, we are making progress. Jason Gorman <a href="http://parlezuml.com/blog/?postid=683">illustrates one way of approaching this</a>.</p>
<p>So, if you are using tasks, consider an alternative approach. First, look at your acceptance criteria, make sure they are more like examples and less like instructions. Once that&#8217;s achieved, consider slicing each criterion (or scenario) horizontally with the tasks rather than the story. Pretty soon, you&#8217;ll find that you don&#8217;t need tasks anymore and you can simply measure progress in terms of the new capabilities you add to your product.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This originally appeared on <a href="http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/7888">my old blog in February 2009</a>.</em></p>
<p>There are, IMHO, some good reasons and some bad reasons to consider switching from Scrum to Kanban&#8230; or for considering Kanban over Scrum as a starting point for &#8216;going Agile&#8217; (so to speak)&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8216;Good&#8217; reasons for considering Kanban are&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Wanting/needing more visibility of specific development process constraints (bottlenecks) than Scrum gives you <em>(Scrum shouts &#8220;there&#8217;s a problem!&#8221;, Kanban points at where the problem is)</em></li>
<li>Kanban can avoid waste of stories not filling a Scrum sprint (although finishing &#8216;early&#8217; can allow teams to make improvements they might not otherwise have afforded themselves)</li>
<li>Kanban can focus teams on vertical stories from the outset whereas new Scrum teams seem to start with horizontal slicing.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8216;Bad&#8217; reasons to choose Kanban over Scrum are&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Wanting to say you are &#8220;Agile&#8221; without really changing your development process</li>
<li>Because using Scrum is exposing rigidity and brittleness of software that is the output of your development process and wanting to hide that behind Kanban words like cadence</li>
<li>Hiding impact of speculative design behind Kanban work-items when it fails in Scrum because the work never seems to fit into a Sprint, spilling the story over multiple sprints</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(by speculative designs I mean implementing architecture that is more than is necessary for current valued-work-item)</em></p>
<p>For a team that has legacy development practices, producing legacy code for which it simply isn&#8217;t realistic to do incremental and iterative development but wants gradual and continuous improvement&#8230; I think Kanban is perhaps a better place to start. Your first &#8216;work-item&#8217; may take 3 months&#8230; but it&#8217;s an honest 3 months! The trick is to make continuous improvements to gradually increase the tempo of your delivery.</p>
<p>If a team needs to suffer the pain &#8211; that comes from seeing that no matter how hard you try you simply can&#8217;t fit the implementation of even the smallest feature into one month &#8211; before it realises it has a problem&#8230; Then maybe Scrum is the better place to start.</p>
<p>Whichever you choose, I hope you choose the right approach for you, for the right reasons <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
