				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://dev.youdevise.com/">youDevise</a> has been one of my clients for a couple of years, introduced to me by <a href="http://www.m3p.co.uk/">Steve Freeman</a>. You can see my influence in various places &#8211; I got them started with Root Cause Analysis (which they took and <a href="https://dev.youdevise.com/YDBlog/index.php?title=hands_on_root_cause_analysis">evolved an entire process around it</a>) and they took the ideas I shared in <a href="http://jnarrate.org">JNarrate</a> and implemented them in their own Narrative framework.</p>
<p>Their CTO has been one of the <a href="http://riverglide.com/clients/youdevise">most vocal advocates</a> of <a href="http://riverglide.com">RiverGlide</a>, the company I created with <a href="http://AndyPalmer.com">Andy Palmer</a> last year.</p>
<p>youDevise are enjoying a period of growth &#8211; driven by demand for their services. They have been <a href="http://www.youdevise.com/careers">hiring developers and testers</a> but are struggling to keep up with demand due to their high-standards &#8211; they value quality over quantity. About 6 weeks ago they had retained my services for 2 days a month for some coaching and consulting. We got talking about the challenges of finding the right talent for their organisation. Then, it occurred to them, perhaps I could help so they asked me if I would consider working for them as a developer, in-between the coaching and consulting days.</p>
<p>This was a great opportunity for both of us. During our relationship so far, I&#8217;d only seen things from the outside. My visits were never more than 1-2 days at a time and involved working with several people looking at slices of problems they wanted to solve or goals they wanted to achieve. I only ever had anecdotal information &#8211; never first hand experience of working in their environment. First-hand experience will give me insights that will contribute significantly to the value I can deliver when coaching their teams.</p>
<p>For me, it meant I would get to work as a team member on a real project. I like to do a tour of duty working on a commercial project for real at least 3 out of every 12-18 months. It keeps my skills sharpened and keeps the advice I give as a consultant honest.</p>
<p>So, here we are. For the next month or two I&#8217;ll be working 4 days per week for youDevise as a consultant-developer, 2 days a month as a coach/consultant leaving me a couple of days a month to spend with other clients and on other projects.</p>
