				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="http://antonymarcano.com/blog/2010/07/being-a-youdevise-developer-introduction">previous post</a>, I gave the background to me spending the next month or two as a developer on a youDevise product.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just completed my first &#8216;official&#8217; week working with them. It was one of, if not, <em>the</em> smoothest of inductions I&#8217;ve ever experienced. I arrived and was shown a desk to work at. There was a welcome letter in front of a dual screen developer machine with Ubuntu installed. The letter told me everything I needed to get logged in, access e-mail and wiki links telling me where to find the rest of the information I needed to configure the machine. For the project I was about to work on.</p>
<p>Their CEO sent out an introduction e-mail telling everyone about me and others who started that day on the development team and in other non-technical departments. I also experienced a warm welcome from the team and was assigned a youDevise mentor to help me settle in.<br />
My first few days involved several presentations &#8211; mostly demonstrative &#8211;  introducing me to youDevise products and their business model. Yet I still got to work on code almost immediately.</p>
<p>I was very lucky to get to pair with their summer intern, Marius Cobzarenco, on a part of an all-new reporting capability for one of their products.  I am so impressed with Marius. He left Cambridge University only three weeks ago and I have to say he is one of the most competent graduates that I&#8217;ve ever met! He has a level of technical competence that rivals many much more experienced developers and he has a passion and aptitude for learning that is rare. He became competent in Behaviour Driven Development after working with me for only an hour or two and <a href="http://twitter.com/AntonyMarcano/status/18509864114">fell in love with the approach</a>. I was so impressed with him that I decided to sponsor his attendance at a TDD workshop this weekend with <a href="http://parlezuml.com/blog/">Jason Gorman</a>.</p>
<p>Marius is a reflection of the high standards youDevise sets for itself. Whenever I&#8217;m there, I never feel like the smartest person in the room.</p>
<p>Speaking of smart people, other youDevisers I&#8217;ve also had the opportunity to work with include <a href="http://www.exubero.com/joe/">Joe Schmetzer</a> and Stephen Siard.</p>
<p>Joe is a great guy &#8211; extraordinarily capable yet incredibly humble. Joe really knows his stuff! I&#8217;m looking forward to sharing with him, but mostly, learning from him. Stephen &#8211; who I have secretly, in my mind, nicknamed &#8216;the professor&#8217; simply because his intellect is especially humbling for me &#8211; is another who I have been very lucky to work with. He has a way with algorithms that is tantamount to wizardry &#8211; but he is far too scientific to be called &#8220;the wizard&#8221; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>These guys stand alongside other similarly impressive and diverse individuals that I&#8217;ll mention in future posts &#8211; each with their unique talents.</p>
<p>Next week, we start a new iteration. I&#8217;ll be seeing what it&#8217;s like working with some of their legacy code. Based on what I&#8217;ve seen so far, at least I know they recognise where they have legacy and that they are passionate about writing tests and cleaning the code up as they go.</p>
