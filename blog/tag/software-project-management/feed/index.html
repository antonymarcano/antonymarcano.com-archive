				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s say you own a restaurant. Quite a large restaurant. You&#8217;ve hired a manager to run the place for you because you are about to take the fruits of your success and invest in opening three more around the country. You leave the manager with a budget to make any improvements he sees fit.</p>
<p>After being away for a few weeks, you return to your restaurant. It&#8217;s very busy thanks to the great reputation you had built for it. The kitchen has some new state of the art equipment and you can see that there are a lot of chefs and kitchen-staff preparing meals furiously. Obviously, with a restaurant this full you have to prepare a lot of meals.</p>
<h3>Too many chefs?</h3>
<p><strong></strong>But then, you notice that there are only a few service staff taking orders and delivering the meals to the customers. Tables are waiting a long time for their meals. You notice the service staff spending a lot of their time taking meals back to the kitchen because they have gone cold waiting so long to be served. You also overhear several customers complaining that the meal they received was not the one they ordered, increasing the demand for the preparation of more meals. You call the manager over and ask him what&#8217;s going on&#8230; he says &#8220;because we need to invest more in the kitchen&#8221;. You wonder why. He tells you &#8220;because there are so many meals to prepare and we can&#8217;t keep up&#8221;.</p>
<p>At this point, it&#8217;s quite obvious that the constraint is not through lack of investment in the kitchen. Instead the lack of investment is in taking the right orders and getting the meals to the customers. To solve this, I think most people would increase the investment in getting the order right and in how the meals get to the customer not by investing more into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Obvious, right? Despite this, time and again, I see organisations happy to grow their investment in more programmers writing more code and fixing more bugs and all but ignore the end-to-end process of finding out what people want and taking these needs through to <em>working </em>capabilities available to the customer. Business analysis, user-experience, testing and operations all seem to suffer in under investment. If it takes you four weeks to write some code for several new features and then another four weeks for that to become capabilities available to your customer, hiring more programmers to write more code is not going to make things any better.</p>
<h3>Sushi and Hibachi</h3>
<p>So, how would you advise the restaurant? In the short term, you can get some of the chefs to serve customers while you hire more service staff. Another solution is to invest in infrastructure that brings the meals closer to the customer, such as in hibachi restaurants where the chef takes the order and cooks the meal at the table or in sushi restaurants where meals are automatically transported via conveyor belt.</p>
<p>In software teams, we can bring the preparation of features closer to our customers. We can involve a cross-functional team in the conversation with the customer (such as the chef being at the customer&#8217;s table). We can also automate a large proportion of the manual effort of getting features from a programmer&#8217;s terminal into the hands of the customer (as in with the conveyor belt). And, there is so much we can automate.</p>
<p>Integration, scripted test execution, deployment and release management can largely be automated. Since speeding up these tasks has the potential to increase the throughput of an entire development organisation, it seems appropriate to invest in these activities as we would in automating any other significant business activity &#8211; such as stock-control or invoice processing.</p>
<h3>Cooking for ourselves</h3>
<p><strong></strong>Why not ask a good number of our programmers to take some time out from automating the rest of the business and automate more of our own part of the business? Taking this approach seems to be the exception rather than the rule. I see organisations having one or two dev-ops folks trying to create automated builds; and similar number of testers, with next to no programming experience, trying to automate a key part of the business &#8211; regression testing. And then asking them all to keep up with an army of developers churning out new code and testers churning out more scripted tests.</p>
<h3>Serving up the capabilities</h3>
<p><strong></strong>Instead, let&#8217;s stop looking so closely at one part of the process and look more at the whole system of getting from concept to capability. Let&#8217;s invest in automating for ourselves as much as we automate for others &#8211; and let&#8217;s dedicate some of our best people to doing so.</p>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s not just about the speed at which we cook up new features. It&#8217;s as much about the speed at which we can serve new, working capabilities to our customers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many years I&#8217;ve been coaching software teams in various things such as Example Driven Methods (xDD), including BDD and TDD; pair-programming; programming; testing; retrospectives; Scrum, kanban and various other ways of getting the most out of a development team. One thing that I notice is that while the teams are being coached, they do amazing things. They are more happy, more productive, fast to improve as if there are no limits to what they can achieve.<br />
<a title="Michael Jordan, Blue Dunk, Lisle, IL, 1987 by cliff1066™, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nostri-imago/4439636726/"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 10px;" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4043/4439636726_a8e5ae9bff.jpg" alt="Michael Jordan, Blue Dunk, Lisle, IL, 1987" width="320" height="214" /></a><br />
Then, at some point they decide that it&#8217;s time to go it alone. I always say to my clients to keep at least one day in their budget for me to go away and come back some time later. Usually within a month or two to see how things are going. Inevitably when I return, the team is doing reasonably well, but not as well as if I&#8217;d stayed involved, even if I was just popping in once every couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Some say that this is what the Scrum master is there for, however, I&#8217;ve noticed that this is something that the Scrum master doesn&#8217;t get to do much of as they are are often dealing with external pressures &#8220;to get things done&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>On many teams, once I move on, there is a coaching void. Despite my pleas and efforts to encourage them to at least establish a coach from someone in-house, the team is often left to just get on with it.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a new idea. For example, <strong><em>Extreme Programming highlights &#8220;the coach&#8221; as a key role in the team</em></strong>.</p>
<p>In sports, teams have coaches. <strong><em>Have you ever heard of a professional sports team without a coach? </em></strong>Can you imagine a professional sports team hiring a coach for a while and then saying &#8211; &#8220;we think we&#8217;re ready to compete on our own now so thanks for your help but you&#8217;re not needed anymore&#8221;. No, I don&#8217;t think so. This is unheard of in competitive sports, yet all too common in competitive business.</p>
<p>Even my 12 year old son&#8217;s basketball team, <a title="Islington Panthers Basketball Club" href="http://islingtonpanthers.co.uk/">the Islington Panthers</a>, has a coach. He trains them 2-3 times per week and he (or an acting coach from the seniors) attends all of their games. In some training sessions he gets a member of the under 21s team to coach the under 13s training session &#8211; so there is always a coach even if they&#8217;re just borrowed from another of the club&#8217;s teams. Without him, do you think any of the club&#8217;s teams would make the national play-offs as they regularly do? Very unlikely.</p>
<p>So, <strong>competitive sports teams always have a coach</strong>. Temporary coaching in a professional sports team is almost unheard of&#8230; Sure, they could get by but would they be taken seriously? Would they be competitive? Would they save money by not having a coach or would this be an obvious false economy? What are their chances of generating sponsorship revenue if they are not winning games? What are their chances of winning games without a coach?</p>
<p>The same applies in software teams. For example, I worked with a client recently and helped a team of 6 people double their output in one day. They&#8217;d have to hire another 7-10 people in order to achieve that but instead, one good coach was enough.</p>
<p>So, if you have a professional software team without a coach, consider, are you really helping your business save money by going it alone? Or, like the professional sports team, is having a professional development team without a coach another example of a false economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>&#8220;Antony&#8221; (without the &#8216;H&#8217;) is the anglicised version of Antonius. In victorian times (there or thereabouts I&#8217;m guessing), among those wishing to appear <em>oh so intelligent</em>, gossip spread that the spelling of &#8220;Antony&#8221; was wrong&#8230; For, so they would say, it is born of the greek word &#8220;anthos&#8221; (meaning &#8220;flower&#8221;) &#8211; oh dear&#8230; so many poor children with misspelt names&#8230;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite being completely wrong, the world forgot of my name&#8217;s etruscan origin and spelt it with an &#8216;H&#8217;&#8230; This misinformation established itself through the eras so much so that, today, the de-facto spelling is &#8220;An<strong>th</strong>ony&#8221;. It has even found it&#8217;s way into the American pronunciation of the name as: &#8220;An-thon-ee&#8221;.</p>
<p>Waterfall development has something in common with this story&#8230; somehow, through misinformation, what it once was has been warped, into something else.</p>
<p>The key difference is that Waterfall is now increasingly represented as was originally intended. Unfortunately for me, my name is not&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Monsters &amp; Legends</strong></p>
<div id="_mcePaste">Some might think that the Waterfall Model is an approach to software development, first explained (but not named) in <a href="http://leadinganswers.typepad.com/leading_answers/files/original_waterfall_paper_winston_royce.pdf">Winston Royce&#8217;s 1970 Paper &#8220;Managing the Development of Large Software Systems&#8221; (PDF)</a>, but they could be wrong&#8230;</div>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/154/352550317_b423336ea9_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="168" /></p>
<div id="_mcePaste">Somehow, it seems to have become something else&#8230; it became the way (many) people thought software should be developed&#8230; the norm for software &#8216;professionals&#8217;. Years of anecdotal failure followed and Waterfall became a legend &#8211; told time and again much like a scary camp-fire story&#8230; The enemy of effective software development&#8230; A monster that will consume all the resources it can, spewing out nothing but documentation, rarely concluding in working software &#8211; at best 20% of the time.</div>
<p>This negative view, to what was once the de-facto approach to software development, is actually far closer to Royce&#8217;s original words on Waterfall than many seem to know&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Truth &amp; Technology</strong></p>
<p>In Royce&#8217;s original paper, he shows a progression of activities, that came to be known as the waterfall model.</p>
<p>What we rarely hear of is Royce&#8217;s original words on the subject:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;the implementation described above is risky and invites failure.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Further to this, Royce goes on to explain that the reason that this cannot work is because there are too many things we cannot analyse up-front:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The testing phase which occurs at the end of the development cycle is the first event for which timing, storage, input/output transfers, etc., are experienced as distinguished from analyzed. These phenomena are not precisely analyzable. They are not the solutions to the standard partial differential equations of mathematical physics for instance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He explains that we need feedback loops. He goes on to warn of (a conservative) 100% overrun in schedule and costs:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;invariably a major redesign is required. A simple octal patch or redo of some isolated code will not fix these kinds of difficulties. The required design changes are likely to be so disruptive that the software requirements upon which the design is based and which provides the rationale for everything are violated. Either the requirements must be modified, or a substantial change in the design is required. In effect the development process has returned to the origin and one can expect up to a 100-percent overrun in schedule and/or costs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of Royce&#8217;s strategies, like &#8220;Involve the customer&#8221; and obtaining early feedback, have lived on in modern (Agile) methodologies. Beyond that, we should remember that his specific recommendations on how to solve the problems of a waterfall model were all based on the technology of the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pot-Roast &amp; The Cost of Change</strong></p>
<p>In 1970, computing was much more expensive than it is today. In those days, changing software was far more expensive than changing pictures and words on paper. It was also much harder to express your design in a human-friendly way in the programming languages of that time. As a result of these and other factors, documentation was a major part of how Royce tried to solve the inherent problems of the Waterfall model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology, tools &amp; thinking have moved on and our documentation no longer needs to be static. It lives. It can breath. The specification can automatically verify that the implementation does what we said it should do (e.g. as in BDD Specs or ATDD/TDD Tests). Modern programming languages allow us to express the design and our understanding of the domain far more clearly, negating the need to first detail our thoughts on paper in natural language. We simply <a href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/conventionalwisdomassumptionsandpotroast/">don&#8217;t have to cut the ends off that pot-roast anymore</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Only now, at the end&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Waterfall, thanks to the popularity of Agile, has gone from something I was shown at school as &#8220;how software is developed&#8221; to being seen in the light that it was originally presented &#8211; how software should <strong>not</strong> be implemented.</p>
<p>This is despite those who still profess the legitimacy of Waterfall and those still shocked and surprised when they hear of Royce&#8217;s own words against the monster he unintentionally created.</p>
<p>As for my name, I hold out little hope for change. I doubt that the world will use my name as it was originally intended and so I have resigned myself to needing two domain names&#8230; one with an &#8216;H&#8217; in it, and the correct one without &#8211; I wonder which one brought you here.</p>
