				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes customer scenarios using Gherkin (Cucumber, SpecFlow etc.) can be harder to read than necessary. Once there&#8217;s more than one &#8220;And&#8221; line in a row, I find that there&#8217;s more clutter than I&#8217;d like and it doesn&#8217;t flow as well when I read it. Let&#8217;s take this example scenario of upgrading a fremium service.</p>
<p><code>Scenario: Upgrade my SomeService subscription from Basic to Pro.<br />
Given I am on the Basic plan<br />
When I upgrade to the Pro plan<br />
Then I see a message confirming the upgrade<br />
And I see that I am now on the Pro plan<br />
And I receive a personal thank you by email<br />
And SomeService keeps a record of when the upgrade happened<br />
And SomeService keeps a record of payment</code></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a feature I rarely see used, the ability to use bullets (with asterisks &#8216;*&#8217;). I&#8217;ve found that using this among steps with Given/When/Then can remove some of the clutter, making the scenario easier on the eye&#8230;</p>
<p><code>Scenario: Upgrade my SomeService subscription from Basic to Pro.<br />
Given I am on the Basic plan<br />
When I upgrade to the Pro plan<br />
Then I see a message confirming the upgrade, and:<br />
* I see that I am now on the Pro plan<br />
* I receive a personal thank you by email<br />
* SomeService keeps a record of when the upgrade happened<br />
* SomeService keeps a record of payment</code></p>
<p>What I don&#8217;t like about this, however, is how the &#8216;Then&#8217; step appears in a different context to the bullets and seems less important. To make sure that all the steps are seen as equally important, I can do this:</p>
<p><code>Scenario: Upgrade my SomeService subscription from Basic to Pro.<br />
Given I am on the Basic plan<br />
When I upgrade to the Pro plan<br />
Then the following occurs:<br />
* I see a message confirming the upgrade<br />
* I see that I am now on the Pro plan<br />
* I receive a personal thank you by email<br />
* SomeService keeps a record of when the upgrade happened<br />
* SomeService keeps a record of payment</code></p>
<p>Note how I&#8217;ve put in a &#8220;Then&#8221; step that segues from the &#8220;When&#8221; to the actual expectations.<br />
A &#8216;Segue Step&#8217; doesn&#8217;t have to do anything, other than transition the reader from the previous steps to a list of expectations:</p>
<p><code>Then /^the following occurs:$/ do #nothing<br />
  #just segue to the next step<br />
end</code></p>
<p>Another way of using a Segue Step could be like this:</p>
<p><code>Then I should:<br />
* See a message confirming the upgrade<br />
* See that I am now on the Pro plan<br />
* Receive a personal thank you by email<br />
And SomeService should:<br />
* Keep a record of when the upgrade happened<br />
* Keep a record of payment</code></p>
<p>Asterisks can replace the opening keyword of any type of step, but using them in this way for Given or When steps could be a scenario-smell, suggesting that the scenario has too much detail or those steps are at the wrong level of abstraction. Using asterisks and Segue Steps are most appropriate in &#8220;Then&#8221; statements with two or more &#8220;And&#8221; lines.</p>
<p>After doing this, reading scenarios without asterisks and &#8216;Segue Steps&#8217; now feels like the &#8220;And Then&#8221; scene from &#8220;Dude, Where&#8217;s my Car&#8221;&#8230;And then? I hope you find it useful to write better scenarios too&#8230; And then? And then? And theeeeeeeeeeeeen! And thenandthenandthen!<br />
