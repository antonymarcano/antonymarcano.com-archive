		<description><![CDATA[That might be a solution in some situations... Although, reducing the menu
options just makes the cooking more efficient. It may reduce the costs in
the kitchen but doesn&#039;t get the meals to the customer any more easily or
quickly unless those funds are used to boost the parts of the system
suffering from under investment.

The problem is rarely budget but perceptions of how much we feel we &#039;should&#039;
have to spend on certain types of things compared to others.  Rather than
looking at the evidence and diverting funds to balance out the throughput of
the whole system, people _feel_ that certain things _should_ cost less than
other parts of the system that are &#039;sexier&#039; or are perceived as the main
value-add of the process.

The trick is to get people to care more about overall throughput of
delivered value above just cutting code or the &#039;cooler&#039; practices of a given
methodology. This is what the Lean movement is really about... making
sustainable throughput of customer-value sexier than coding or branded
management methodologies or anything else... And to do this, the movement
fights fire with fire by becoming a branded methodology (or collection of
branded methodologies). But that is a whole different blog post..

Ultimately, people will always do what they _feel_ is right even if all the
evidence points to that being less effective than an alternative... And that
is the rather subtle subtext of this story :-)]]></description>
