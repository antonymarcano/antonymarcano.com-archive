		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Improved version &#8230; I think </p>
<p>Given I am on my microsites home page<br />When I add a &#8220;Gallery&#8221; subpage<br />Then I should see the &#8220;Gallery&#8221; subpage</p>
<p>There is no need to have two descriptions for one concept: subpage and document<br />Do we really need to talk about &#8220;title&#8221; yet.</p>
<p>Still have an issue with this which is:</p>
<p>Where are we after we have added the subpage &#8211; on the home page, or on the subpage. Maybe its not yet important</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, guys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;ve recently found that trying to use persona/actor names right from the very first acceptance test really helps when starting to write code (from the outside-in). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would be interested to know if it&#039;s as helpful for the non-programmers in an organisation. I suspect it would, at the very least, encourage the team to establish an ubiquitous language for their domain.]]></description>

<p>  Given I am logged in as an Editor</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>  Given I am an Editor<br />  and I have a microsite with a homepage<br />  When I Add a Subpage with a Title of &#8220;Gallery&#8221;<br />  Then I should see a document called &#8220;Gallery&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey James,&lt;br&gt;For me, I would generally use a role name from the outset. If we were working from story cards, then it would probably say something like &quot;As a FitNesse User...&quot; and I would then put that in straight away.&lt;br&gt;However, if I was refactoring someone else&#039;s Cucumber tests from a mixture of Activities and Tasks to just Activities, I would probably preserve their narrative format. (I probably wouldn&#039;t change their tabs to spaces either :-) )]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Antony, under what circumstance would you consider it beneficial switching from the first to the third person narrative in these scenarios?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;m thinking of the Fitnesse Narrative example, where you used a descriptive name (e.g. Fitnesse User) in the third person throughout the acceptance test. Is that an important technique in ATDD or did it just make sense in the context of the metaphor you were using for NarrativeFixture?]]></description>
