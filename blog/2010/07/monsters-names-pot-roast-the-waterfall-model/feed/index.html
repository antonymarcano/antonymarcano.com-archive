		<description><![CDATA[The more interesting part of the Royce paper is the conclusion in the end:&lt;br&gt;&quot;Figure 10 summarizes the five steps that I feel necessary to transform a risky development process into one that will provide the desired product. I would emphasize that each item costs some additional sum of money. If the relatively simpler process without the five complexities described here would work successfully, then of course the additional money is not well spent. Ii, my experience, however, the simpler method has never worked on large software development efforts and the costs to recover far exceeded those required to finance the five-step process listed.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, the question is, whether Agile is a way to overcome the five-step process and outperform the costs I need to invest into the methodology. Maybe it&#039;s time for science to re-visit this statements after 40 years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment Rob.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe he was talking about the way people did things at the time. He had some great points, either way. Regardless, there are those that argue in favour of a waterfall approach (either explicitly or indirectly). I meet them occasionally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes I meet people who put forward arguments against iterative approaches. I can also use some of the arguments in my blog post in these situations too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I agree that if someone is in favour of a Waterfall approach and uses the name explicitly, just showing them Royce&#039;s article probably won&#039;t change their opinion. Showing them my article might ;-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People I meet who do talk in favour of a waterfall approach (as a moniker or otherwise) do tend to find it a revelation when I share Royce&#039;s words with them since few of those I&#039;ve met have ever read the article.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks again for your comment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s more subtle than that. The reality is that nobody who delivers anything useful is really doing waterfall. They have to iterate towards a workable solution just like the rest of us. To hit the nail on the head first time is as unlikely as a golfer hitting a hole in one. What tends to happen is that they try to get it right first time, and then end up with a whole bunch of change requests (often masquerading as bug reports) which they have to tackle in very short feedback cycles during what&#039;s commonly referred to as a &quot;stabilisation phase&quot;. On these projects, this is where most of the actual lessons are larned and value is added.]]></description>
