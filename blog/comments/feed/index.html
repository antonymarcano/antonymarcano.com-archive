		<description><![CDATA[(Very) belated comment, but Gherkin is very flexible. Common misunderstanding is it&#039;s not, but if you look at it as code (which is what it is), it becomes a programming type exercise.  It&#039;s just another layer of abstraction (the next layer up from the acceptance test code).  Multiple &quot;should&quot;&#039;s for example, can be treated as an array, in Gherkin.  Common steps can be bundled as one Gherkin statement, when specifying complete steps are unnecessary.   Forms can be processed as tables, rather than lengthy &quot;I fill in this with that&quot;.  Developers appreciate the well-structured scenarios, as it guides them better too.  BDD a commitment thing, and so is the Gherkin - it does take time to build up, but you end up with a suite of executable natural language features, and strict QA.  It kept a good project momentum going too.  The Gherkin art is in keeping it readable, but not letting it stand still.  And of course documenting, and alerting others to new Gherkin available to use.  The out-the-box Gherkin is a bit mundane, but picks up on many common steps - we are not as original as we think.  Where the value becomes apparent, is as the test application grows, and more custom Gherkin(DSL) is created.  The value even better demonstrated when integrated with the app it is testing.  Becomes it&#039;s own development/testing machine ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The issue you highlight, of people thinking of user stories as ‚Äúwhat the user will have‚Äù, is a very pertinent one.  This no doubt leads to vague user stories we have all seen. Like reading an answer, before you know the question.  Or the uncomfortable shoe-horning, of the sometimes chaotic human thought process, into the standard user story template.  This is a reason I am such an advocate of Behaviour-driven development, as the focus is on capabilities (to borrow your term) or scenarios (I believe these are in similar area).  Whereas techies tend to look for path(s) and caveats, by default in user stories, clients tend to go straight for the destination, loaded with assumptions. That long-acknowledged, but narrowing gap in translation of requirements to code was improved by evolution of Agile, but the skill of writing user stories is still very underestimated!  On projects, I think it is very important for people to push back on user stories, if clarity isn‚Äôt there. Surprisingly how little this happens - perhaps it‚Äôs a confidence things, and fear of a user story review, coming across as criticism.  But I guess that is another discussion :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice parallel !

I&#039;m all in for the idea of &quot;tags&quot; instead of &quot;job titles&quot; and was agreeing with the whole text until that phrase:

&quot;the task that is the most relevant and valuable to the 
team at that time, within the context of the project‚Äôs goals, rather 
than just the tasks of most relevance to my job title&quot;

Sometimes, the project goals may be harmful and blind the team to some other tasks that someone &quot;knows&quot; has to be done (like a new tool to analyze some data or the POC of some technology that no one in the team have expertise yet and they may need in the future). A &quot;responsible specialist&quot; may use some &quot;free time&quot; to tackle some of those tasks, while someone &quot;following the goals&quot; would pick up the next Sprint story...

Of course, If the PO is a nice person and the team has a good relationship with him/her, those tasks can be made visible and emerge in the next planning meeting and may even have a higher priority than a Story would :) In that particular case, the &quot;just follow the goal&quot; approach would work well]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s an easy test for your user story: Will it make sense if the &quot;user&quot; is blind and quadruplegic?
Or another test: Will it make sense in a technology-free fantasy-book?

If yes, than the user story probably describes actions and interactions of agents.
Otherwise you describe features of some software behaviour within a certain technological device.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your comment Coyote. Indeed. Mike also pointed this out in his book, &quot;User Stories Applied&quot;, in the chapter &quot;What Stories Are Not&quot;. He summarises this again at the end of the chapter: &quot;It is more important to think about users&#039; goals than to list the attributes of a solution.&quot;

I suspect that many people who make the mistake of feature-orientation haven&#039;t read Mike&#039;s book, certainly not properly. So, I thought I&#039;d try to provide a shorter explanation that gets the point across in a different way.

I think that part of the problem is that many people look at the apparent simplicity of user stories and just do what they&#039;ve always done except with a superficial application of the Connextra template (As a...I want...So that...). They may read literature on the web and find plenty of examples (written by people with the same assimilation bias) that support their assumptions and association with their past experiences of &#039;requirements&#039;.

This focus on features is natural. I&#039;m pretty sure there was a time where I also thought of stories in this way. This is explained quite well by a quote from Udi Dahan:
&#039;Users ultimately dictate solutions to us, as a delta from the previous set of solutions we‚Äôve delivered them. That‚Äôs just human psychology ‚Äì writer‚Äôs block when looking at a blank page, as compared to the ease with which we provide ‚Äúconstructive criticism‚Äù on somebody else‚Äôs work.&#039; -http://www.udidahan.com/2010/05/07/cqrs-isnt-the-answer-its-just-one-of-the-questions/ 
Quote Highlighted: https://diigo.com/01uzg5

It&#039;s not just users, it&#039;s also those who may represent the users such as Product Owners and Business Analysts. So, I thought I&#039;d try to help people see the impact of feature-oriented stories rather than goal-oriented stories on their agility (as in the dictionary definition of the term). I hope people see this article and see the opportunities for increased flexibility and speed-to-market as an incentive to better understand the subtleties of user stories.


Thanks for reading.]]></description>
