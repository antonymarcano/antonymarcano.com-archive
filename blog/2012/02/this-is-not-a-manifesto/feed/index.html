		<description><![CDATA[I quite like that!  Matches up well with my own drivers - although, as usual, you have expressed it much better than I could! 

Looking forward to the elaboration around Quality specifically.  I have been spending a lot of time recently (more than a year so far) trying to delve into what Quality is - what people mean when they use the word, specifically in terms of software but generally as well.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback Bob.

I can&#039;t promise definitions but I can promise an elaboration of the feelings that those words represent for me :-)

I like the idea of &quot;progress&quot;, although it doesn&#039;t connect with me as well as &quot;advancement&quot;. I had considered it and chose advancement instead.Mostly I chose it because it connected with how I feel. I completely understand your concerns about the message it might send. I hadn&#039;t considered the &#039;selfish advancement&#039; issue... And I would hope that my team-mates wouldn&#039;t be thinking that way. My experience on teams is a sense of fellowship where this sort of thing generally isn&#039;t a concern. We advance as a team. I recognise that this isn&#039;t always the case.

Advancement, for me, is more than progress. It&#039;s about making advances in progress and our ability to make progress.

Thanks again for taking the time to give me feedback. The more I get, the deeper my understanding of these ideas gets.

		<description><![CDATA[Nice post. Maybe would have chosen &quot;progress&quot; as a label in preference to &quot;advancement&quot; (too easy to mistake for personal advancement aka selfish ambition?). And I&#039;d say the Quality over Quantity balance is, at least in part, context-dependent.

Looking forward to reading your definitions...- Bob]]></description>
